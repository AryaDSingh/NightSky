# NightSky

The idea for my project was to create a telescope few of space.
The scene will change everytime it is rendered as it is randomised.

For reference i looked at this photo

I wanted to add more complex shapes and structures akin to something more like

But the task proved to be too challenging for the given time.

As for chapter-6-12 
I Added some opacity effects to the stars to give a "twinkle" effect.
And messed around with blending to create light sources so it looks more interesting.

I used HTML Canvas to create this. I had to read up on some of the functions
